# Seatbelt-Alarm-System
LED Alarm System for seatbelts in vehicles.


Driving without fastening the seat belt was one of the most common traffic offenses in India. With 6,175 charges laid in the first six months, Young drivers were the least likely to buckle up their seat belt. In the year 2011 a survey conducted, it was found that 55% university students did not consistently wear a seat belt.I decided to work on this project that ensures that the driver wears his or her seatbelt at all times. To do so,I decided to make an LED Alarm for the safety of the driver and passengers in a vehicle. The LED lights up when the driver is not wearing the seatbelt thereby prompting him/her to do so.
